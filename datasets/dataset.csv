hi my nine year old son had a cough and flu symptons three months ago and the chesty sounding cough and green phlegm still remains. it did seem to get better but never totally went and has now picked up again...he has only ever had antibiotics once in his live which suggests he his generally fitand well and active...never short of breath or weezy...so why would this be....,"Hi...

Thank you for consulting in AI Clinic.

I understand your concern and would explain that his symptoms could be related to viral infection or bronchitis (infection of the airways).

In my opinion, we should first rule out lung infections as well because it can cause similar kind of coughing with green chest pains which is common after flu season.

So get done clinical examination of respiratory system including PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) along with Chest x-ray to confirm diagnosis.

If both these are normal then no need to worry about any serious illness like pneumonia.

"gyno problemsfor the past few months, I have been having issues with my vagina. there always seems to be something wrong with me. its either an infection or a yeast infection from the medication used to treat the previous infection or a herpes outbreak as a result of a yeast infection. most recently, I had a uti. I was treated for that and everything seemed fine, until after I finished the medication. it still hurt when I had sex and still is uncomfortable to pee. I dont know whats going on and this has been going on for months.","Hello, I have studied your case.

You may need to get a urine routine and culture done for the diagnosis of herpes infection or yeast infections in vaginal cavity as it can cause irritation on sexual intercourse with pus discharge from bladder due to bacteria present at this site like cystic lesion etcetera which is common after UTI so you should consult qualified Urologist who will examine you properly regarding these conditions also take treatment accordingly Hope this answers your query If you have additional questions or follow-up queries then please do not hesitate In AI Clinic forum",3,0
"i had surgery done 5 months ago for scar tissue and adhesion removal. my gynecologist just found a cyst on my right ovary. im still having problems, when my husband and i have sex i get severe cervical pain and afterward i get abdominal cramps severe enough i get light headed, also i get abdominal pain and rectal pain before and during a bowel movement, i also get abdominal pain during urination. im 26 years old. what could it be?","Hi, Thanks for writing in.

The cyst on the right ovary is not related to any infection or inflammation of your pelvis and can be due to some other cause like anemia (inflammation) which may lead you pain during intercourse with abdominal cramping etc...

You should consult qualified Urologist who will examine it thoroughly so that proper diagnosis could also help us know what type of problem there are....

If I were your doctor then we would have advised ultrasound abdomen done as well.....if this was normal than no need to worry about pregnancy because these symptoms might worsen after surgery but do get yourself examined by surgeon again",3,0

I am also on Zoloft 150 daily, adderall 30mg bid & clonazepam as needed who I take a few night a a week","Hello, Thanks for writing to us.

I have gone through your question and understand the concern you are having regarding elastase liver disease (PCO).

It is not possible that it will be related with EASTASIS or any other cause of cardiac failure in family members who may need surgery as well because there might also been some bleeding from heart vessels which could lead to severe damage due to this condition like hemorrhage etc...

So please consult an endocrinologist once again so we can rule out these causes",3,0

Thank you for consulting in AI Clinic.

Skin conditions are best diagnosed only after seeing directly, so that we can guide better treatment options based on the severity of symptoms and overall health concerns.

I suggest using topical antihistamines (such as cetirizine or albuterol) to relieve pain and swelling.

Paracetamol may be given at nighttime but not always prescribed by your doctor because it is very effective against infection like tuberculosis.

Hope my answer was helpful for you! Wishing her good health",3,0
"I feel as though there is a liquid near the surface of my upper left chest muscle near the arm pit that burns when I lean foreword in a standing position. The burn is very intense like a white hot iron is slouching in that area. just started 4 hours ago and is increasing in area. feels liquid in nature, but i feel no bump and it may be inside rib at that location? do not feel it by putting finger pressure in general area.","Thanks for your question on AI Clinic.

I can understand your concern.

By my opinion, you are mostly having musculoskeletal pain (pain in the armpit).

So better to consult orthopedic surgeon and get done 1.

Clinical examination of chest 2.

PUT (Pulmonary Function Test) 3.

Chest x-ray 4.

CT scan of abdomen.

If both these tests show normal then no need to worry about any muscular injury or muscle spasm.

Sometimes stress and anxiety also cause similar symptoms like burning sensation at elbow joint etc.

You may require analgesic such as amylase along with antihistamine",3,0
"My 3 year old daughter complains headache and throat pain since yesterday. Shes also having a hard time sleeping right now. She doesnt have fever but shes asking for blanket, telling me shes cold but were in a tropical-hot country and its really humid-hot right now, so Im really concerned if shes alright.","Hi...

Thank you for consulting in AI Clinic.

I think your kid is having viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all unless there are fever episodes or bloody discharge from the room (if any).

Once this episode comes down, we can start using anti-inflammatory medications like cetirizine to relieve symptoms of headache/ throat pain etc.

So do not worry about duration & frequency as these medicines will only give temporary relief but they may take some time after few days because sometimes allergic reactions occur during such cases which usually resolve within 2-3 weeks with proper treatment.

Regarding cough sensation on sleeping position suggest that she should be given warm compress over her chest twice daily along with analgesic gel under local application once per day before bedtime.

Hope my answer was helpful for you! Wishing good health to our daughter!!",3,0
I had a wisdom tooth extracted nearly 3 weeks ago. unfortunately some of the block went into my jaw muscle and I now have trismus. More alarming though is that my facial muscles feel very much weekened and smiling is an effort. Also I have had twitching above my lip and up cheek and under eye. I am very concerned as I am a music teacher. please help,"Hello, Thanks for consulting AI Clinic.

I have gone through your query and can understand what you are going through in relation to the wisdom tooth extraction or twitching above lip of cheek etc...

You should go ahead with treatment as per planification by doing an ECG which will give more information about how much pain is there....

If it doesn't work then consult dentist again who may advise further management like root canal therapy along with anti-inflammatory medication such as amoxicillin 500u00a0mg once daily.....

pcod irregular periods 37x31mm cyst in LT ovary on11july its my first day. 7x7mm inRTovary and 11x12mm inLT ovary on22 july 12day. 11x12mm inRTovary and 8x9mm inLT ovary on27july 17day. 1 what does this mean? 2 IS ovulation happen this time? 3 slow and late growth of follicle as in my case .ISany chance of getting preganant? 4 what to do now? 5 plssssssssssss answer soon,"Hi, Thanks for writing in.

The ovulation is not expected to happen this time and it will be delayed by 3 days or so as you have mentioned that your periods are irregularly occurring during the fertile period of pregnancy (which may occur on early mornings).

You should get an ultrasound done which can help us know what type of cyst there was before conception but also whether any other abnormalities were present after egg formation etc...

If I am my treating doctor then we need some investigations like routine blood sugar test(CBC) along with hormonal profile including thyroid function tests/ serum creatinine levels....

Hope these answers would serve purposeless purposes",3,0
i have had many signs and symptoms of pregnancy like a lte period getting sick the veins on my sides are very noticable and on my arms and chest and legs but i took a test it came back negative and then i was a week late but after that i got my period. is there any way i could still be pregnant? i also have leg cramps and pains in my arms too,"Hi, I have gone through your question and understand the concern.

You are having a very rare pregnancy with no symptoms of any other signs or abnormalities in menstrual cycle which is not related to periods as you mentioned that it was negative for period but still there were some reports like blood test positive so this could be due to hormonal imbalances also leading to irregular cycles (increased fertility) etc...

If these tests come normal then chances of conception will decrease by more than 2 weeks after missed date....

So consult an Obstetrician who can examine you properly before taking medicines.....

The pain went away after about 24hrs but ever since then I have been walking with a slight limp, I have very little strength in my right calf and my lower leg swells up every day after walking for about an hour.","Hi, Thanks for writing in.

I understand your concern and would explain that you are having a very low chance of conception after tuberculosis infection (TB).

Thank you for consulting in AI Clinic.

I understand your concern and would explain that his symptoms could be related to viral infection or lung infections (like pneumonia).

In my opinion, we should first rule out cardiac cause because these are common causes of coughing with green chest pains which is due to poor immunity from the virus causing this kind of problem like asthmatic attacks etcetera.

So get done clinical examination of respiratory system including PFT(Pulmonary Function Test) along with Chest x-ray to confirm diagnosis.

If both these tests show normal then no need to worry about heart diseases as they can also lead similar type of problems such as chronic cold weather conditions wherein there might not been any relief after few months without treatment however consult pediatrician once again on all reports regarding severity of disease but better management will depend upon result of investigation report followed by complete blood count test at home before starting antibiotic therapy according to findings found otherwise nothing much troublesome happens during fever episodes",4,0
"My arm is broken, what should I do?","Hi, Thanks for writing in.

The fractured arm is a very common condition and needs to be treated with an anti-inflammatory medication like amoxicillin or metronidecoside along with some painkillers such as paracetamol (if you are not allergic).

If the injury persists then it can take up to 6 months of time depending on severity of damage caused by this disease which may require surgery only after proper clinical examination.
